To fix this, use a unique identifier from each item in your data as the key.  Assuming each item has a unique `id` property:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <MyComponent item={item} />}
  keyExtractor={item => item.id} // Correct key extraction
/>
```

By using a unique `id`, FlatList can efficiently track and update only the necessary components. This results in a significant performance improvement, particularly when dealing with numerous items.
